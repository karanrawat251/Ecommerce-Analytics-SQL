# Ecommerce-Analytics-SQL

This project focuses on analyzing sales and customer data from a simulated e-commerce platform. The analysis explores customer behavior, order trends, and product performance to extract insights that can support business decision-making.

Using SQL, I have worked on data from three interrelated tables: Customers, Orders, and Order_Items. The queries range from basic data retrieval to advanced analytics involving joins, aggregation, ranking, and time-based filtering.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains three CSV files that represent different aspects of the e-commerce system:

Customers
Fields: customer_id, customer_name, email, signup_date, country
Description: Stores customer details and their country of origin.

Orders
Fields: order_id, order_date, customer_id, total_amount, status
Description: Contains order details, including order dates, customer references, and order status.

Order_Items
Fields: order_item_id, order_id, product_name, quantity, price_per_unit
Description: Tracks individual items purchased within each order.
